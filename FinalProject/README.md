--- README FILE FOR VIDEO SYNCRHONIZER (Final Project) ---

This script/html file was made because I saw a very specific need from my friends on Discord
Often times we like to watch videos on YouTube together but of course we also want to be synced-up when we watch. 
This is a tool that ensures we are always synced-up. 

This tool takes a youtube link input, grabs the video ID from YouTube, and updates the html doc to show the embedded video.
What makes this nice is the clock on the page that is up to date with the current time, which means everyone using this tool will be able to say "start at 30 seconds" or "start at the next minute change" or something like this.

I wanted to have the videos simply autoplay when set to a certain time but apparently Youtube does not allow this as far as I am aware. Also, because the videos are embedded, there can be issues with strangely formated videos on Youtube.
For example, Youtube shorts do not seem to work (which is fine because I did not intend this to be used with shorts) and any video which prohibits embedding for whatever reason will have issues.


Running the script is pretty straightforward, but I will explain it anyway.
You will paste a link to the Youtube video in the box and hit submit. The video will then appear in 1920x1080p in the middle of the page.
When the clock hits the agreed upon time between you and your friends, you will hit play, and that way everyone will have hit play at (basically) the same time.
If the script does not like the link you gave it, it will tell you it is invalid.
