This is a quick explanation of the project1.ps1 script.

The script is very short and simple and is really more a showcase of how the speech synth can be used than anything else.
You have the ability to change the voice with another line or two of code but I did not include this because it seems as though Windows only comes with two voices by default.

I am not sure what I would use this for in the future but I thought it sounded interesting to me.
