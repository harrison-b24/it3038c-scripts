-- Project 2 Readme --

This powershell script does a few things. First, it will read whatever text is put in the "REPLACE THIS TEXT" quote using the built-in speach synth.
Second, after reading the text, it will ask the user if they would like to save the audio generated by the inputed text to a .wav file.
Lastly, there is simple error detection built in that will notify the user if something goes wrong.

To use this script properly, you will need to change two things in the script. First you must change the "REPLACE THIS TEXT" to whatever you want the synth to say.
Otherwise, it will just say "replace this text", obviously.

The second thing you must change is the path to where you want the file saved. If you don't plan on saving any files however, this is not necessary.
I have defaulted the format to save in the "music" folder on your windows user folder, but this means you will need to change the USERNAME portion of the file path to whatever your windows username is.
